--------------------
- Use your normal AWS credentials: a named profile from ~/.aws/config (e.g. default) or environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).
- Do NOT set AWS_PROFILE to your account ID. Use a profile name (e.g. default) or leave unset to use the default profile.
- Set the region: export AWS_REGION=eu-north-1 (or your action's region).
